# Renovate Custom Manager Demo

Demonstrate how to use renovate to update a custom-versioned system in arbitrary files and code.

## Version

A simple case for basic versioning: `basic-v4`.

More complex versioning, with interleaved elements of package, version, and prelease tags:
  * `complex-3.9-purple-002`
  * `complex-3.9-purple-variant-001-limited-12-24`
